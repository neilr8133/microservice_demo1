# Assignment
Create a simple REST API and attempt to show what you consider ``best practices''

# Overview
Create a REST API which has more than 1 API call in the language of your
choice. The API should demonstrate best practices for REST, programming, and
maintainability. The project should have some sort of simplified build (Makefile/setuptools/Maven/etc..) which makes it easy to build and run the
project. The project can use a database, but if a database is used, it should
be something which is simple to run in a testing environment
(SQLite/HSQLDB/etc...).

# Requirements

1. More than 1 REST API endpoints
2. Demonstrate use of HTTP verbs as they relate to REST
3. At least 1 of the REST endpoints should trigger some business logic inside of the application
4. Unit tests

# Bonus Features
The following, optional, features would demonstrate advanced abilities and improve
consideration for the position:

* Async Processing
* API Documentation (Swagger/RAML/etc…)
* Docker deployment (Create a docker container to run the application)
* Unit Test coverage calculations
